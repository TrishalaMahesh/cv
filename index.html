    <br>San Jose, California</p>
    <p>I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering at San Jose State University. I’m currently looking for full-time opportunities in the field of Cloud Computing, Software Engineering, and Project Management. I enjoy roles that are challenging and diverse. I enjoy both leading projects and contributing at a high level and appreciate roles that allow me to do both. In doing that I am able to wear a variety of “hats” in order to get the job done. I have experience working on the MERN tech stack to construct a variety of online applications. I've worked with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Redux, Node, Express, Kafka, and Web Sockets. I've dealt with both document databases like MongoDB and relational databases like MySQL.</p>
